## A New Coat of Paint ##
Over the past two days, I've been reworking my website along with the design. I've been inspired a lot lately by flat design and how it looks. A lot of my inspiration came from Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 because I feel that the look is so elegant in design and I wanted to have a stab at it. 

Since there aren't many flat Octopress themes I decided to make my own after all of this work.
