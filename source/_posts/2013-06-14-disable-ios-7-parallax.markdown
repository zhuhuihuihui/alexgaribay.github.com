I've been using iOS 7 since the day it was announced. And I'm loving the design changes so far. It uses flatter design but not completely flat, which I am okay with. One aspect that I do not like is the parallax feature, which makes the icons and background change orientation to give a psuedo 3D effect.

###Disabling the Effect

1. Open the 'Settings' app
2. Tap 'General'
3. Tap 'Accessibility'
4. Tap the switch for 'Reduce Motion' to be in the on state
