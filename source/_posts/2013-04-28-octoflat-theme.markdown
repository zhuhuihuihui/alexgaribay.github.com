## Beginnings ##
I have created my first Octopress theme today called Octoflat. The theme is inspired by flat design. It uses [Twitter Bootstrap]("http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/") and Designmodo's [Flat UI]("https://github.com/designmodo/Flat-UI"). All the colors chosen are the colors listed on Flat-UI's demo page.

#### Calling for Help #####
I need help making the theme more customizable to the end user. So any help in doing so would be greatly appreciated.
