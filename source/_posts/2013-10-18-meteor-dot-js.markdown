I've been spending some time learning about Meteor.js. It is a really neat web framework built on top of Node.js. It allows for easily creating real-time web apps build utilizing MongoDB as the data store. I suggest taking at look at the project at [http://meteor.com](http://meteor.com).

If you you do become interested and want to learn the framework quickly, I recommend the book [Discover Meteor](https://www.discovermeteor.com). The book goes into great detail on how Meteor works and how to get an app running quickly. It's a great resource to learn Meteor in general.
