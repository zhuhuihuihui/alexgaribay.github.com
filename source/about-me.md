###Who am I?
I am Alex Garibay. I’m a simple guy with a passion for learning about new technologies and electronics. I was born and raised in Kansas and haven’t lived anywhere else. I went to Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas to get my B.S. in Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.

###My Occupation
I currently work at NetSmart Technologies working on creating benchmarking and analytics products for care providers and their electronic health records (EHRs).

###My Hobbies
Aside from learning about technology, I have a few hobbies:

* Listening to electronic music
* Creating electronic music
* Learning all sorts of web technologies
* Running (using barefoot shoes)
* Having fun with friends
* Karate and Kobujistu (purple belt in both systems)

I got into electronic music around middle school and immersed myself in it in college. I liked it so much that I learned how to create my own songs (I have a small musical background from playing percussion in band when I was younger). My songs can be found on my <a href="music.html">Music</a> page.
